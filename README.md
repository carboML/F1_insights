# F1_insights

### Overview

This are just some notebooks to create cool plots with F1 data. The data comes from https://ergast.com/mrd/ . 
Thanks to the API's of the webpage, I'm able to JSON that files and covert them into pandas. After that, it's all python.

### What you need
The librarys used in this project are:
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `request`
* `Json`
* `Pprint`

You will also need an internet conexion, at least until you convert all the info into pandas dataframes.
